Status: Proposed

TL;DR: Provide a minimal ADR example for tooling and format validation.

## Context
We need at least one ADR in the repository so the index tooling and validation can run.

## Decision
Use a minimal ADR that demonstrates the required header and optional metadata fields.

## Consequences
The ADR index has stable, validated data to build on.
